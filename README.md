# PropTest - Fib
![Workflow badge](https://github.com/disalazarg/proptest/workflows/test-format-verify/badge.svg)

A simple project for showing property-based testing using a generator for the Fibonacci series.

You can also check out my [blog](https://dsalazar.cl/blog/tech/2020-12-08/a-quick-intro-to-propertybased-testing) for a quick overview of the code.

## Usage

As usual, simply:

```bash
$ mix deps.get
$ mix test
```

That should run both sets of properties alongside the lone regular test.
